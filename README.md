# Eyeblink-to-english-trranslator-using-eye-blinks
Smart Eyewear project developed as part of the Microprocessors and Microcontrollers (MPMC) course. An IR sensor on spectacles tracked eye blinks and encoded them into Morse code (dot, dash, space) based on blink duration. Arduino converted the patterns into English text. Audio output was planned but not complete.
