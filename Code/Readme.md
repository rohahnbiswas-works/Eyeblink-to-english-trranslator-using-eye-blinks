This file contains the code that we used to create the device which could encode eye blinks into morse pattens and then convert them into understandable english by using suitable logic.
As you know morse code encodes letters in terms of dots and dashes. So we had planned the working such that a short blink meant a dot and a longer blink meant a dash.
Also we have given different duration of blink time to tell whether its another new letter or a completely new word.
I have added the code as a txt file.
